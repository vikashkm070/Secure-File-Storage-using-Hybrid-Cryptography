                                <p>The primary goal of this project is to provide and simulate an effective solution to 
                                    face the challenges and solve security issues that exists in cloud computing. 
                                    Cloud Computing is the impending need of computing which is used for the IT Industries
                                    It is one of the hottest topic in research areas. Scalability and Flexibility increases
                                    for the computing services. Cloud Computing is the fastest growing technology for IT Industry.
                                    The Information is being transmitted via the network therefore security is one of the main
                                    problems or issue. The Application is deployed on the Cloud and for the secure transmission
                                    of the data we will be using ECC Algorithm in our project because of its advantages in terms
                                    of CPU utilization, time for Encryption and Key Size. This Project will explore the deployment
                                    of Application on the Cloud and increases the security level by implementing ECC & ECDH Algorithm,
                                    and AES Algorithm for secure file handling and Encryption.</p>
